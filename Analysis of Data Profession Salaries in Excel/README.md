# Analysis of Data Profession Salaries in Excel

This project was created while reviewing excel to prepare for interviews. Data was taken from a Kaggle data set titled “Data Science Salaries 2023” which contains information on the salaries of individuals within the realm of Data Science professions. This includes information such as the job title, salary, experience level, employment type, and company location. The data set can be found using the following link:

## Functionalities Used:
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
- Charts
- Vlookup
- Custom formulas with string functions and nested if statements
* Note: The dashboard is the only sheet visible. To view the worksheets with the rest of the functionalities listed above, unhide the other sheets.

## The workflow of the project was as follows:
- I initially explored the data using filters, modified existing columns, and created new columns that would provide additional insightful to the dashboard later in the project
- Pivot tables were created to summarize key points of the data set and visualizations were then made off of each individual pivot table.
- The charts were then compiled into a dashboard and filters were put on the appropriate visualizations to make the dashboard interactive and dynamic.

## Findings:

The data profession with the highest average salary that was not an executive level was a Data Architect. They had an average salary around $160,000. The three most numerous professions in the data set were Data Engineers (44%), Data Scientist (28%), and Data Analysts (18%). When filtering the data for a full time, entry-level Data Analyst based out of the US, I found the total number of jobs has been steadily rising since 2020. Remote data analyst jobs have been the most rapidly growing since 2020 and the in person jobs have been rising since the end of the pandemic in 2022. As of 2023, the average salary for Data Analyst jobs have been comparable regardless of remote status; the average salaries for in person and hybrid statuses have been positively increasing for the past year while the average salary for hybrid status positions have been slightly decreasing.
