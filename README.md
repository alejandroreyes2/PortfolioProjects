# PortfolioProjects
This portfolio contains a collection of projects I have completed while learning to become a data analyst.

2019 Flight Data Exploratory Data Analysis – Personal Project	(_March 2023_)
- Used Python to investigate and make sense of a dataset with over 6.4 million records
- Applied Pandas functions such as groupby and loc to explore patterns and relationships  in the data
- Developed data visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium to glean meaningful insights and draw conclusions 

SQL Project on a Dataset of Udemy Course Ratings – Personal Project	(_January 2023_)
- SQL was used to create a relational database in which the data was mapped to
- The statements Alter Table, Update, Set, Case When, and the function Convert were used to clean the data
- Window functions were used to aggregate the data in data exploration without condensing the rows during output 
- Tableau was used to create dashboards highlighting the findings from the SQL queries according to desired specifications

Music Store SQL Project – Udacity Project	(_November 2022_)
- Used SQL to determine the volume of sales generated by individual playlists using the With CTE
- The Join statement was used to inform the relationships between the data found across multiple tables
- Subqueries were used to find data specified by the prompt and the rest of the data was filtered accordingly using Join

Arabidopsis thaliana Genotype Analysis – Computational Biology Project	(_November 2021_)
- Used R to understand differences in gene expression between time of collection vary by genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana  
- Principal Component Analysis was done using the function prcomp
- The libraries ggplot and pheatmap were used to show the separation of genotypes and to visualize clusters
