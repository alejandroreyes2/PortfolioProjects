# PortfolioProjects
Throughout this portfolio, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my use of Python, SQL, R, Excel and Tableau. Each project has its own README file that goes into more depth than the brief synopses that can be seen below. 

Featured Projects:

1. 2019 Flight Data Exploratory Data Analysis in Python – Personal Project	(_March 2023_)
- Used Python to investigate and make sense of a dataset with over 6.4 million records
- Applied Pandas functions such as groupby and loc to explore patterns and relationships  in the data
- Developed data visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium to glean meaningful insights and draw conclusions 

2. SQL Project on a Dataset of Udemy Course Ratings – Personal Project	(_January 2023_)
- SQL was used to create a relational database in which the data was mapped to
- The statements Alter Table, Update, Set, Case When, and the function Convert were used to clean the data
- Window functions were used to aggregate the data in data exploration without condensing the rows during output 
- Tableau was used to create dashboards highlighting the findings from the SQL queries according to desired specifications

3. Music Store SQL Project – Udacity Project	(_November 2022_)
- Used SQL to determine the volume of sales generated by individual playlists using the With CTE
- The Join statement was used to inform the relationships between the data found across multiple tables
- Subqueries were used to find data specified by the prompt and the rest of the data was filtered accordingly using Join

4. Arabidopsis thaliana Genotype Analysis in R – Computational Biology Project	(_November 2021_)
- Used R to understand differences in gene expression between time of collection vary by genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana  
- Principal Component Analysis was done using the function prcomp
- The libraries ggplot and pheatmap were used to show the separation of genotypes and to visualize clusters

Other projects:

1. Analysis of Data Profession Salaries – Personal Project	(_May 2023_)
- Used Excel to investigate and manipulate data to create an interactive dashboard that highlights key statistics relative to job availability and compensation
- Utilized vlookup to supplement the existing data table with information from another data table.
- Implemented custom formulas (with nested if, string functions, etc) to create calculated columns and modify existing columns
